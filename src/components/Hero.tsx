          As a passionate web developer and software engineer based in Malaysia, I've had the
          privilege of working on a diverse range of projects, from corporate websites to mobile
          applications. I thrive on tackling complex challenges, refining user experiences, and
          crafting scalable, efficient solutions that make a lasting impact.

          Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active and exploring my personal interests. Whether I'm
          pushing my limits at the gym, immersed in a gaming session, or spending quality time with
          family and friends, I find that these experiences keep me energized and inspired, fueling
          my creativity and passion for learning.
